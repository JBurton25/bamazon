After creating the product database on mysql, the code was copied over to a schema.sql file. The .js file of bamazon with dependences of inquirer, mysql, and table-read allows the user to view the inventory, choose an item and quanity, and make a purchase.  The table then automatically updates to show the remaining inventory.  The client may Quit the transaction at any time.
